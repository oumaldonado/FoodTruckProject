# lessons learned
This project helped me better understand setters and getters and how they work. It also allowed me to solidify my keyboard short cuts. Also to use my IDE more effectively to maximize my productivity. I learned how to store data in arrays and to access that data. I understand visibility and the 4 types of fields (Private, Protected, Public, Default). The 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) which are (Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation). Lastly the importance of TDD ( Test Driven Developing) and the role it plays in the cycle of software engineering.
